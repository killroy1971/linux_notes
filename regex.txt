grep ^b...$ /usr/share/dict/words - Find words starting with "b" with any three characters (the three periods).  The dollar sign signifies where the search should stop.  This search will produce any four letter words that start with the letter "b."

egrep '^b[a-z]{3}' /usr/share/dict/words -- Same as above, but will ignore punctuation (like apostrophes).
 - The curly brackets {} indicates repetition.  "egrep" is "extended grep" and uses REGEX.

More EGREP:
