# Linux Network Analysis

## Common network issue causes
- Incorrect DNS addresses
- Incorrect netmask
- Incorrect MTU
- Duplicate IP address

## Incorrect DNS addresses
  - Examine the nameserver addresses in /etc/resolv.conf
    Attempt to perform a nslookup or dig using each address as the server address
    nslookup <ip-address> <item-to-query>
    dig +short <nameserver-ip-address> <item-to-query>
    dig -x +short <nameserver-ip-address> <reverse-dns-item-to-query>
  If you can't perform non-fqdn dns queries on local subnet items:
  - Examine /etc/resolv.conf and look for a "serach" line.  It will contain DNS zones to search first.
    Add or edit this line if it is incorrect.
    
## Incorrect netmask
ping -M do -n 1460 <target-ip-addr>
- Increase -n by 10 till you see: "ping: sendto: Message too long"
- Decrease -n by 2 untill packets aren't fragmented

## Dupcliate IP address
  - Log into the questionable system via a console.
  - Log into a second system via a console.
  - On the questionalble system, shut down the network interface hosting the questioned ip address.
  - On the second system, try to ping the questioned ip address.
