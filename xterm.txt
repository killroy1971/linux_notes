XTerm Configuration
===================
Configuring your X environment
------------------------------
Unix systems use a windowing sytem known as X-Windows.  It doesn't matter if
you see a window manager like KDE, GNOME, CDE, etc.  X-Windows is at its base.
So how is this useful?  With a few "dotfiles" in your home directory you can
create a predictable computing environment across several differnet networks.
Let's start with the "console" window or "terminal emulator."  Usually this 
is xterm or ddterm.  Find out which with the command: "Echo $TERM" and 
record the finding.

.Xdefaults
----------
#Xdefaults file.  For each terminal type: xterm, ddterm, vt100, etc. 
#create an entry beginning with the terminal's executable name as
#shown below for 'xterm.'
#Xterm
xterm*foreground: green
xterm*background: black
# Note: gemoetry is collumnsxrows
xterm*geometry: 80x50
#ddterm
ddterm*foreground: green
ddterm*background: black
ddterm*geometry: 80x50

You'll have to re-login before these changes take effect.
